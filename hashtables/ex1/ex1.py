# Merging Two Packages

Given a package with a weight limit `limit` and a list `weights` of item
weights, implement a function `get_indices_of_item_weights` that finds
two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit `limit`. Your
function will return a tuple of integers that has the following form:

```
(zero, one)
```

where each element represents the item weights of the two packages.
_**The higher valued index should be placed in the `zeroth` index and
the smaller index should be placed in the `first` index.**_ If such a
pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return
`None`.

Your solution should run in linear time.
